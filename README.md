# SPA-0927-promise-valid-input


 Create a function called "isInputValid" that takes in a single parameter and returns a new promise.
 
  The promise will "resolve" or "reject" after 1 second, depending on the input:
 
  - it will resolve if the input is a number with 4 or more digits
  - it will reject if it's anything else
 
  After your function works, connect it to the DOM:
 
  - the input value must come from an input field
 
  Remember that the value read from an input is always a string so, first thing, you should try to convert it to a number
